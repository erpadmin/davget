# davget

**davget** is a standalone binary for listing and recursively downloading files (akin to `wget`) from WebDAV servers.

This tool was created for use with [Pydio Cells](https://pydio.com/) public links (after appending `/dav/` to the URL). Itâ€™s ideal for users who prefer to recursively download files from the CLI rather than the web portal.

## Usage

### Recursively download all files
